# markov_melodies
Explores the simulation of melodies through Markov models.

Running this requires having numpy, MIDIUtil, and music21 installed.
To do this, execute the following commands in a terminal.

```
pip install numpy
pip install MIDIUtil
pip install music21
```

You can confirm that the installation was successful by running the main.py file. Doing so should produce a MIDI file in the same directory, called 'new_midi.mid'.
